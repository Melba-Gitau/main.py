#this is my version Of the popular game: Rock,Ppaer, Scissors game.
R represents rock,S represents scissors and P represents paper.The rules are simple:
If the two players choose the same “character” it’s a tie, and the game repeats.
Rock beats Scissors
Paper beats Rock
Scissors beats Paper
R represents rock,S represents scissors and P represents paper.
