#this is my version Of the popular game: Rock,Paper and Scissors.
R represents rock,S represents scissors and P represents paper.
The rules are simple:
If the two players choose the same “character” it’s a tie, and the game repeats.
Rock beats Scissors
Paper beats Rock
Scissors beats Paper
If player inputs a choice not present its an error.
